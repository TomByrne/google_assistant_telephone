# Google Assistant Rotary Phone

- For running no-hail Google Assistant from an old rotary phone, according to [these instructions](https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/turn-a-rotary-phone-into-google-assistant-with-raspberry-pi).
- Forked and modified for use with a Pi 3 instead of a Pi Zero, which I couldn't get working per https://github.com/googlesamples/assistant-sdk-python/issues/267. Skips the overnight compilation step in favor of pre-built binaries
- Pi 3 can fit in a 1972 Bell 500 under the rotary dial, you just have to remove it temporarily to get it in there
- This was also a helpful resource for getting the speaker and mic working with an external USB audio interface: https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/80072/how-can-i-use-an-external-usb-sound-card-and-set-it-as-default
